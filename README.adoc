:toc: macro

Rewrite system designed for symbolic manipulations and maximal expressiveness.

== License

BSD license, you can modify as you like. Contributions are welcome.

== Jupyter Interface

Very experimental interface. You should copy 'data/kernel.json' into
the directory '~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/rewrite'.

----
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/rewrite
cp data/kernel.json ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/rewrite/
----

Start the jupyter notebook with `jupyter-notebook --Session.key='b""'`;
you can find a sample notebook in 'data/notebook1.ipynb'. The `make jupyter`
target will do the same.
